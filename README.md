<h1>Bonytics:  Pediatric Bone Age And Growth Analysis Using Deep Learning</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to predict bone age and classify bone density from hand X-ray images. 
The Bone Age Prediction module aids pediatricians and endocrinologists in estimating a childâ€™s skeletal maturity, identifying growth plate status, and categorizing bone growth stages. 
Meanwhile, the Bone Density Classification module helps assess bone quality, identifying risks like osteoporosis or abnormal density levels.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bone Age Prediction and Distribution: Build a model to predict bone age from X-ray images and analyze the age distribution across groups.</li>
<li>Bone Growth Stages and Growth Plate Status: Classify bone growth stages and predict if growth plates are open, partially closed, or fully closed.</li>
<li>Bone Density Estimation: Estimate bone density using features from X-ray images</li>
</ul>
