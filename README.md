<h1>Bonytics:  Pediatric Bone Age And Growth Analysis Using Deep Learning</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bone Age Prediction and Distribution: Build a model to predict bone age from X-ray images and analyze the age distribution across groups.</li>
<li>Bone Growth Stages and Growth Plate Status: Classify bone growth stages and predict if growth plates are open, partially closed, or fully closed.</li>
<li>Bone Density Estimation: Estimate bone density using features from X-ray images</li>
</ul>
